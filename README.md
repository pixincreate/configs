# Configs

This repo contains all of my development configs. I never had a backup of these before and hence this repo.

## Contents

- VSCode profile: Pastel theme with the extensions that I use
- Unixified powershell profile
- Extras:
    - GPEdit and HyperV enabler (Run in admin mode)
    - Winutil
- Registry Edits
- Theme
- Powershell Profile and Setup with Starship

## Powershell for better life (Admin / sudo recommended)

Make sure you install a [NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest) (FiraCode Mono is preferred) and is selected in your terminal
