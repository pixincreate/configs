# Configs

This repo contains all of my development configs. I never had a backup of these before and hence this repo.

## Contents

- VSCode profile: Pastel theme with the extensions that I use
- Extras:
  - GPEdit and HyperV enabler _(Run in admin mode)_
  - Winutil -- _This is not updated_
- Registry Edits
- Desktop Theme
- Unixified Powershell Profile and Setup with Starship

## Powershell for better life (Admin / sudo recommended)

### One line powershell profile installer

```pwsh
irm "https://github.com/pixincreate/configs/raw/main/powershell/setup.ps1" | iex
```

**Note:** Make sure that you select the FiraCode font in `terminal > Settings > Defaults > Apperance > Font Face`
